Inspired by a post on the H3H3podcast's [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/16op37y/why_ethan_should_not_listen_to_members_chat_data/),
where user u/Norishoe used OCR to the determine the number of unique chatters, I decided
to do something similar for PaymoneyWubby's [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/paymoneywubby) chat.

We all've seen or heard of laws or patterns like the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) or the [80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle#In_business), where 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. I wanted to explore if this was true for PaymoneyWubby's chat, to ask the question _what percentage of the chatters are responsable for what percentage of the chat messages?_, aka how much _oneguyed_ does wubby get?
